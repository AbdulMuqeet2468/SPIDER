**Understanding Battery Basics**
When designing or choosing a battery, it is required to know the basic parameters that defines it's performance. 

DISCLAIMER: Handle all the batteries with care. Make sure to wrap insulation at the ends while soldering! Do not short circuit them!

*Types of Batteries:*

1) Li-ion (Lithium ion Cells):
  - They have a rigid outer structure with high energy density and stable output.
  - has long cycle, commonly used in laptops, mobile phones etc
  - Nominal voltage: 3.7V per cell

2) LiPo (Lithium Polymer):
  - Flexible (not very rigid) and lightweight with very high energy density
  - High discharge rate
  - Sensitive to over charging and discharging
  - Nominal voltage: 3.7V per cell

3) NiMH (Nickel Metal Hydride):
  - Safer and less expensive but heavier and lower energy density.
  - Nominal voltage: 1.2V per cell.

4) Lead-Acid:
  - Common in automotive and backup power systems.
  - Heavy and bulky but inexpensive and robust.
  - Nominal voltage: 2V per cell.

etc etc...

*Voltage* : The potential difference of a single cell, usually 3.7V
Voltage increases if cells are connected in series. example: if 3 cells are connected in series => output voltage = 3 x 3.7V = 11.1V
